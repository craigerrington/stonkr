# Stonkr

EDIT: While this notice is still here, I haven't changed it enough from CryptoTicker to call it something new. But stonks are en route.

Run with

```
python TickerLED.py &
```

Based on [`nigel-hall-codes/CryptoTicker`](https://github.com/nigel-hall-codes/CryptoTicker) and [`hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix`](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python/samples)
