# CryptoTicker
Check out my [blog post](https://medium.com/@HallyouGot/cryptocurrency-led-ticker-af0e27f35149) on this project: 

Here is all the code needed to run a Cryptocurrency ticker tape on a LED board using a raspberry pi.  This assumes following the tutorial on hzeller's github project regarding setting up the LED's found [here](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix).  

Be sure you can run the sample python LED codes found [here](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python/samples)

Once that works you can download this project and simply run 

    python TickerLED.py &
    
Your board should light up as soon as it downloads the first set of Crypto prices.
